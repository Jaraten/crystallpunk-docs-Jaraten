> [!WARNING]
> This page is out of date: We are not tying into the expedition format as the main scenario of the round. The article is awaiting a rewrite.

Depending on the selected map, different scenarios can be run on it.

**Scenario is a set of elements selected before the round that form the main storyline of the entire round.**
A scenario consists of:
- [Protagonists](https://github.com/crystallpunk-14/crystall-punk-14/wiki/Protagonists-%5BENG%5D). 
	- Expedition Goal. The primary objective (or objectives) for the entire ship's crew, displayed and tracked in the character's menu. Fulfilling the expedition goal is the primary task of the shift, and it determines the “success” of the round.
	- Personal Motivations. Some expedition members may have their own unique goals related to the scenario and the player's role. These may be positive or neutral.
- [Antagonists](https://github.com/crystallpunk-14/crystall-punk-14/wiki/Antagonists-%5BENG%5D). Various forces whose purpose is to thwart the fulfillment of the expedition's goal.
	- Primary objective. To prevent the fulfillment of the expedition's goal. This can be an indirect antagonist goal, such as how to destroy an elemental ship.
	- Side Objectives. Different antagonists may have their own side goals.
- Random Events. A list of random events that may occur during the course of a runud are determined by a particular scenario.

## Scenario Design Rules

When creating a scenario, make sure it adheres to the following rules:

**All roles available on the map** must participate in accomplishing the expedition objective. If a player can join as an engineer, it is necessary to provide that engineer with a job in any scenario. However, some roles will be required in any scenario by default, such as cooks - the expedition will have to be fed in any scenario anyway, and so it is not necessary to take such roles into account.

**Worldly solutions are not the answer**. It is important to make sure that it should be impossible to fulfill both the expedition's goal and the antagonists' goals at the same time.

## Example Scenario

The map “Ruins of Xandia” - A vast area of forested ruins of a city lost in a great war. 
Xandia's Treasury Scenario - Beneath the ruins of the lost city, a treasury full of valuable resources and valuable Elemental Core remains. Unfortunately, its exact coordinates have been lost and the entrance is sealed with a complex mechanical lock.

Goal of the expedition: Extraction of the Elemental Core. Protagonists receive the key to the treasure room, and must bring the elemental core to their ship.
Personal Motives:
- Mercenaries: Steal ancient coins from the treasury
- Cooks: Prepare dishes from plants that grow only in this region.
- Priest: Repair a ruined temple, and dedicate it to any god.

Antagonists. Can be varied, such as:
- Cult of the Dragon of the Deep. Mercenaries who have joined an expedition to capture the elemental core for their own purposes. They believe that. 
	- Main Goal: To drop the elemental core into the “Great Gap”, a giant chasm shaped like the mouth of a dragon. 
	- Side goals: Drop X shards of Khyber into the yawn.

Random Events. Different events depend on the map. For example, for the Ruins of Xandria, located in dense forests, the following events may occur:
- Rain
- Storm
- Falling Shards of Syberis
- Contact with the Dolurr Plan (Plan of the Dead).
- Awakening of Xandia's mechanical guards (mapped in advance)
