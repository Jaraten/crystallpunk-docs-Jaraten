# Visual style decision

Given that we can't use most of the Space Station 14 art and content, and we need to draw and create our own content, we have the option to set our own visual style from the beginning. All CrystallPunk14 art design must follow the rules below:

## Color Palette

For the visual integrity of the project, you should adhere to the specific color palette located in this folder.

![palette](https://github.com/crystallpunk-14/crystallpunk-docs/assets/96445749/9a60beeb-62a1-48b2-bc84-94be69fecceb)


Deviations from the palette in tone and hue are allowed, but the primary colors should adhere to this solution.

## Style /TG/Station

Tgstation has found an extremely pleasing visual style for cc14 sprites, which consist of the following elements:

### Perspective 3\4

Only sprites with a perspective of 3\4 are allowed. From this perspective, only the front and top of the object are in the player's field of view.

This rule applies most strongly to large objects and structures where the overall shape of the geometry is fairly simple (cube, sphere)

For objects with complex shapes, like swords, deviations from this rule are allowed.

### Perspective of ovals, circles on the example of a cylinder.

### 5 shades

The style does not imply strong realism, and gradients of dozens of shades. For each main color in the sprite you should choose about 5 shades, which will be distributed on the sprite according to the following scheme:

Of the key elements:
- The top surface is always brighter illuminated than the front surface
- The front and top edge are separated by a bright light glare
- Presence of contrasting stroke
- The stroke follows the first three rules, having a glare, and a brighter top.
- Avoiding sharp corners when appropriate. Smoothing by removing corner pixels.
