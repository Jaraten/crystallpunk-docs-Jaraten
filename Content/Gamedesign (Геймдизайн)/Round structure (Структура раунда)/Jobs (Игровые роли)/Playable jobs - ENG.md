# Game Roles

A game role is a representation of a specific type of gameplay. **Each role has clear objectives in the round and a scope of activity**.
Game Roles are divided into 2 categories.

## Mercenaries

These are free roles that can technically do anything. **The main purpose of mercenaries is to make money**. The main way to earn money in a round should be by completing the expedition organizers' tasks.

Example role:
- Alchemist. Scope of activity - turning resources into consumables (potions). Goal - earning money. Expected gameplay - brewing and selling potions.

## Expedition Organizers

Leadership roles that cannot be antagonistic. **They share the common goal of fulfilling the expedition's purpose**. Organizers do not have to carry out these goals themselves, and the main gameplay of these roles is the social organization of mercenaries, motivating them with wages, and controlling their activities. **Organizers should have gameplay advantages** that make them important in the eyes of the mercenaries.

Example of a role:
- Housekeeper. Scope - controlling the expedition's resources, selling and buying them. Purpose - To fulfill the expedition's goal. Gameplay - Providing the mercenaries with resources to fulfill the goal.

# Vibe

Each role has clearly defined “vibes” of a specific scope of activity when it comes to gameplay. The Alchemist mainly works with vials, stirring various reagents, and the atmosphere of the activity fits the stereotypical idea of what Alchemists do. 

# Mechanics.

The cor mechanics of a role should support and enhance the vibe while allowing for fun interaction with other roles. Each role has its own design document that determines what type of gameplay that role focuses on. 

The gameplay mechanics of different roles may overlap, but the mechanics of a particular role should be primarily utilized by members of that role during normal gameplay.
