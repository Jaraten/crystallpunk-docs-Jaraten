CrystallPunk14 is a project that tries to capture the experience of oneshots (one-off scenarios) from tabletop RPGs. The most important difference of the project from other “computer versions of TRG” such as Baldurs Gate 3, Pathfinder and other big RPG franchises is the mmo component of the project.
The almost complete absence of NPCs, and a large number of players in different roles provide the game world with lively stories, and the game mechanics only need to provide players with enough tools and motivation to generate these stories.

This details the basic design principles of the project, which all mechanics and decisions made during development must adhere to.
These are not rigid principles, but if your mechanics do not conform to the principles below, they will be scrutinized before acceptance.

## 2. Complexity

SS14 has come a long way from being a simple atmospheric simulator, but it has built an important aspect into the core of the game - **deep simulation gameplay**. The natural complexity of the sandbox, combined with the unpredictability of human players, creates a truly chaotic environment where anything can happen. It is important to provide players with the right mechanics while encouraging unique situations to arise.

Realism is not important, and can end up causing gameplay problems and greatly raise the entry threshold for players. **It is much more important that the mechanics/modeling be intuitive rather than realistic**. If a system models an item completely realistically, but requires someone with a PhD to understand how it works, that's a serious problem.

Any simulation-based mechanics or interaction should be easy to learn based on in-game information alone and **not require diving into a wiki or textbook to understand**.

## 3. Variability

When designing mechanics, it is important to be attentive to the player's ability to choose different options, and to provide enough information to shape that choice. If your choices are too simple, or conversely, too overcomplicated by the sheer amount of information, the player's choice becomes a “false choice” when there is only one “right” answer.
Another word for this is Meta-game (Meta), or when some choices are more efficient than other choices, and become the only rational choice. **Avoid designing mechanics in such a way that a Meta can occur**.

**Any action has consequences**. When a player interacts with a mechanic, their actions must have a result. That result can be positive or negative, but it must be there. If a player screws up and can't create an item from the materials at hand, a “you failed” message is not enough (the player will just try again). Resources may be ruined, the player may get hurt, or some other commensurate event must occur that affects the player's next action.

**There is always room for error**. When designing any mechanics, you should leave plenty of places where players can intentionally or accidentally make mistakes. This means that in any activity, there are several options for what they can lead to.

**Interaction with existing systems**. New mechanics should also be integrated with existing mechanics wherever possible, to further increase the variety of potential outcomes that players get when interacting with them.

Care should also be taken to ensure that **the actions of some players do not overly restrict the actions of other players**, especially when conflict is involved. If the mechanics involve conflict, both sides should be given some options for counterplay, ideally in a way that is skill-dependent.

This also applies to non-combat interactions: avoid creating situations where players are drawn into mechanically, or by metagaming. **The player should never feel that there is no choice in their situation**.

## 4. Progression

The average duration of one round-scenario is **one and a half hours**. And during this time, the game situation should never be the same. This can be achieved by the following methods:

**3 stages of character ability progression**. When you design a mechanic, think about how you can ensure that your ability to interact with that mechanic expands over the course of a round.
There are 3 basic stages:
- Roundstart. (0-30 minutes of play). Think about the level at which players can interact with your mechanics at the start of the round.
- Mid-round. (30-60 minutes of play). Think about how players might be exposed to new ways to interact with your mechanics by this time. 
- End of round. (60-90 minutes of play). Provide players with some very cool opportunities that appear near the end of the round. It is important that these opportunities come as a result of player activity, not on their own.

**Instancy**. Day turns to night, random events periodically affect the round, and your mechanics may not be constant either. Some key parameters may change over time or as a result of player actions.

## 5. Seriously ridiculous

CP14 is essentially a horror comedy: on one side you have a cruel government that doesn't care about its inhabitants, sending them beyond the borders of the explored world and exposing them to the terrifying dangers of dangerous uninhabited zones, and on the other side you have buffoons and incompetent assistants causing all sorts of hilarious disasters.

The situations that regularly occur in CP14 are absolutely insane, but players tend to take them seriously. When you create content or mechanics, you should take this dissonance into account and accept the fact that something can be silly and serious at the same time.

When creating new mechanics, try to imagine how **everything could go incredibly awful and ridiculously ridiculous** (or right, depending on who you ask). Try to create situations that would be funny to hear as a story, but would be scary for the player to find themselves in.

## 6. Player Interaction

**Mechanics should strive to be prosocial and encourage interaction with other players**. These interactions need not be strictly cooperative or competitive in nature, but they should eventually have at least a side effect on other players' gameplay.
Humans are chaotic and unpredictable, and their participation in the game brings a depth and replayability that no linear mechanics can achieve.
And it is this power of the human element that we must maximize in our mechanics. Mechanics that involve single player gameplay, or mechanics that are not affected by events that occur in a round and/or actions taken by other players, will likely not be added to CP14.

That said, while role separation for interactions is important, **key mechanics for the round should not be locked down and only available to some players**. All gameplay important to the performance of the game should be available to every player. This is important to ensure that gameplay is possible even with extremely low online play. 
We can still make unique optional gameplay that improves the quality of life or is a more efficient counterpart to the features available to most.

Complementing this principle is a preference for **replacing mechanics or NPC characters\antagonists with real players**, for example by using ghost roles, or by designing mechanics like economy so that it is dependent on player actions rather than external game-mechanical parameters.
