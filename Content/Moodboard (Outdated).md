# Moodboard

This document is a temporary framework for the creation of the subsequent lore, setting and art style, gameplay design and everything else.

Everything in here is not binding, just an emotional impression of the world Ed wants to make.

## Main Objective

Space Station 14 is currently a unique game that has no analogues. Its main points of interest for players are its deep mechanics and the possibility of role-playing wagering. 
However, the game is crammed within the chosen Space Station setting. 

A huge number of people around the world love the opposite side of sci-fi setting - fantasy, mysticism, Lovecraft and similar things. All these elements would look extremely out of place in a game about, literally, a space station. And even the space wizards from the offs don't really pull for an interesting image.

The CrystallPunk project aims to fill that hole. Using the working gameplay design of Space Station 14, we create a setting, visual style and mechanics that allow you to play fantasy and roles, and try on the masks of innkeepers, mercenaries, bards, blacksmiths and so on.

In order not to dwell purely on the magical theme, the design should also be implemented mechanisms in the style of steampunk, dieselpunk, or technomagic basis. This will both expand the audience to steampunk fans and make the setting less banal.
